# Office365

ROMBI AI has the full suite Office365 and it is leveraging the following features:

* Office Suite: Excel - Power Point - Word

### Document templates
PowerPoint and Word templates are available at `Documents > Templates` for sharing content and presentations with customers and external collaborators.

# SharePoint

Sharepoint is the **official** repository for documentation. Each team has one Sharepoint site where we store all kind of informations ( requirements, notes, documentation ) related to the customer/project. Everything is immediately shared with the team and available online, so it can be linked to media.
Customer and external people will not access it, if you want to share something with the external world you have to share single files through OneDrive and protecting them with one to one sharing mode.
It is an individual responsibility to feed Sharepoint with as much information as possible, organizing documents in a searchable and understandable way.
Sharepoint sites can be automatically synchronized with your local PC, so you can work on your local file system and having background synchronization.


# Teams

Microsoft Teams is the preferred way to communicate within the team, but if you want to be sure someone will take an
 action you have to write an email.
Each ROMBO AI member receives an Office365 account during the onboarding phase which will grant access to Teams.

**It is strongly encouraged to use personal pictures/portraits as Teams avatars and to turn on your webcam during calls
in order to improve empathy and social relationships with colleagues.**


### Do Not Disturb Hours
Teams mobile app supports "Quiet Time" so you won't be pinged in the middle of the night or while you are dealing with family matters. You can set your "Quiet Time" by clicking on Notifications and then Hours without notifications. You also have the option of disable notifications on your mobile app if Teams is already active on your desktop. See Teams documentation for more information.

### Quick Search
Teams provides some shortcuts that allows you to switch between channels and direct messages quickly. Invoke it with Cmd + E on Mac or Ctrl + E on Windows or Linux and start typing the name of the person to chat with or the channel you are interested in. You can then navigate the suggestions with ↑ and ↓ keys and hit enter to select. To navigate only channels use Cmd + G on Mac or Ctrl + G on Windows.

### Hide conversations with no unread activity
With lots of channels and direct messages, Teams can become overwhelming. To help keep track of activity on Teams, and to simplify the interface, consider hiding conversations with no unread activity.
