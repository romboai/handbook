# Development Methodologies

We adapt our processes to the nature and complexity of each project. Currently, ROMBO AI adopts two primary methodologies:

## Agile / Scrum

- **Iterations (Sprints)**: Typically two weeks in length.
- **Sprint Ceremonies**: 
  - **Planning**: Define sprint goals and scope.
  - **Daily Stand-ups**: Short meetings to discuss progress and obstacles.
  - **Review & Retrospective**: Evaluate completed work and gather feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Product Backlog**: Managed by the Project Manager (PM) and prioritized based on business needs.

## Kanban

- **Continuous Flow**: No fixed-length sprints. Tasks move through columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) in a just-in-time manner.
- **Work in Progress (WIP) Limits**: Helps maintain focus and prevent overload.
- **Frequent Delivery**: Suitable for support tasks and projects that require quick responses to changing requirements.

By using these methodologies, we ensure transparency, regular communication, and continuous improvement within the Engineering teams.
