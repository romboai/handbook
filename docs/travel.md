# 🌍 Travel Policy – ROMBO AI  
### “No rules, just responsibility”

## 1. Core Principle
At ROMBO AI, we don’t need strict rules — we trust each other to act with **good judgment, responsibility, and integrity**.  
When you travel for work, spend company money as if it were **your own**, and remember you’re representing **the whole team**.

---

## 2. When to Travel
- Travel only when it brings **real value** — for a project, for building relationships, or for learning something that helps ROMBO AI grow.  
- Prefer video calls or virtual meetings if they achieve the same outcome.

---

## 3. Booking and Expenses
- Choose **efficient but reasonable** options: direct flights if necessary, trains when practical, comfortable but not luxury hotels.  
- Use any booking platform you prefer, as long as the cost is **transparent and sensible**.  
- No pre-approval is required, but **keep your team informed** if the trip affects budgets or planning.

---

## 4. Deductible Expenses
The following expenses are **eligible for reimbursement and tax deduction**:
- **Travel costs** (e.g. transportation, accommodation)  
- **Meals** related to business travel or meetings  

Other personal or leisure-related expenses are **not deductible**.

---

## 5. Reimbursement
- Keep all receipts or digital proof of payment (photos, emails, apps).  
- Submit expenses with a short note explaining the **purpose of the trip and its value to ROMBO AI**.  
- There are no fixed limits, but **use balance and common sense**.

---

## 6. Personal Extensions
- You’re free to add personal days or bring your family — just make sure the **boundary between business and personal expenses** is clear.  
- ROMBO AI covers only the portion **directly related to work**.

---

## 7. Environmental Impact
- Whenever possible, **choose sustainable options**: take the train instead of flying, share rides instead of traveling alone.  
- If that’s not possible, consider **offsetting or carpooling** with colleagues.

---

## 8. Trust and Transparency
- No formal approval process — just **full personal accountability**.  
- When in doubt, ask yourself: *“Would I make this choice if it were my own company?”*  
- Share your learnings and takeaways with the team after each trip.

---

## 9. In a nutshell
> “Spend it like your own money, travel only when it matters, and share what you learn.”
