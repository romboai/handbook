# Philosophy and Technologies

## Focus on Solutions

At ROMBO AI, we prioritize understanding the problem and choosing the approach that best addresses it. **Technology selection** is secondary to solution design. We value flexibility in choosing the right tools for the job.

## Commonly Used Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: We frequently use **Python** for its versatility and rich ecosystem of libraries.  
- **Cloud Platform**: Our primary deployment environment is **Microsoft Azure**, but we remain open to using other platforms if they better suit a given project.
- **No Strict Restrictions**: Although Python and Azure are commonly used, there are no hard limitations on adopting additional technologies when they offer advantages for performance, scalability, or maintainability.

## Continuous Learning

We encourage ongoing research and experimentation with emerging technologies. Engineers are free to propose the adoption of new frameworks or tools as long as they align with overall project goals and team consensus.
