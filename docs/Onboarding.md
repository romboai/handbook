# First two weeks

In ROMBO AI, the first two weeks are dedicated to train on different technologies based on Manager indications and to explaining the company culture.
The owner of the company culture and operative information is the Buddy. This part should be done mainly during the first week.
The owner of the tech training, following the manager indications about different technologies, is the first team leader. The tech training should start in the first week, but it should become more consistent in the second week.
For the new employee, the first week will be tracked in Elapseit with the project 'YYYY Agile Training - Onboarding'. The project for the second week will be suggested by the first team leader.
The time spent by the buddy (usal 5-6 hours for each onborading) will be tracked also with the project 'YYYY Agile Training - Onboarding'.

In "BigData" Sharepoint there are the official Agile Skill courses that must not be shared with external world. This material can be then integrated with other resources in case of need.

# On boarding follow up

<div class="pill">process: buddy</div>

As buddies we never leave the persons we have helped during the on-boarding phase, our accountabilities will always be "sponsoring the company values" and  "helping the people we on-boarded".

The on-boarding follow up process goal is to measure:

* How many concepts are successfully communicated during the on-boarding phase
* How many concepts are remembered or forgotten by the person we on-boarded
* How many concepts we don't talk about during the on-boarding (but we should)

And understand:

* Why things that are remembered (we should reinforce those)
* Why things are forgotten  (should we stop talking about it? are there any reason?)
* Are there things that are helpful to coaches that we should talk more in the on-boarding phase?
* Are there things that the coaches do not know? (we should remind them of those)

## Process steps

* As soon as you start on-boarding schedule the follow up call in 6 months
* Ask the on-boarded person what they found useful in the 6 months timeframe
* Ask the on-boarded person what they did not find useful in the 6 months timeframe
* Go over the onboarding checklist again and note what the on-boarded persons remember and what they do not rememeber
* Interview the coach and ask the same questions about topics in the on-boarding checklist
* Interview the coach and ask what we should talk more in the on-boarding phase
* Ask the on-boarded person to rate their buddy again with the same on-boarding quiz
