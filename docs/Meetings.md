# Meetings

- Try to be punctual for meetings, regardless of your company position. If no one shows up within 5 minutes of the scheduled time and no prior notice was given, the meeting is considered canceled.
-People's time is valuable, and we should not reschedule meetings, even by 15 or 30 minutes, just because we have another commitment.
- If I am added as an optional attendee to a meeting, I am free to decide whether to participate.
- If I am invited to a meeting and believe I don't need to be there, I can simply ask to be removed.
- Most meetings should be wrapped up within 20 minutes.
